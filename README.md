## Getting Started

The Kubescape extension for Lens will help you to easily scan and detect misconfigurations, software vulnerabilities, and RBAC (role-based-access-control) violations in your Kubernetes cluster.

#### Cluster-level information

* Navigate to `Kubescape` from the side menu.
* A Kubescape scan runs automatically on your cluster for the first time. You can also run a scan on-demand by clicking the __Scan__ button.
* The table reflects a cluster-level summary of Kubescape scan results.
